## 🎮 Quick start

To start using Luigi van der Dyne just https://luigi.dyne.org/

## Adding new formats

### 1. Create a new design function
First, running a command that will ask you a couple of questions to create a new design functions from a base (template, example or blank):

```
yarn new
```
Choose

```
❯ Template
❯ React Image (SVG)
```
And give it a proper name (eg. event_twitter_card, linkedin_banner...), this will be the name of the template asset and the folder in which we now have to work, let's say it's called `listen_to_podcast`

### 2. Insert the layout

So in Luigi everything works in svg ;)
Let's go and find some awesome .svg layouts in our figma projects and export it as shown below:

![howto_2](./static/02_howto.png)

Options show be as follow:
- [x] Include 'id' attributes
- [ ] Outline text

specially is important to Uncheck **Outline text**

Now export the svg copy the content inside the file and paste it into your new created `functions/listen_to_podcast/index.js`

at line 11-13 
replace
```javascript
  return (
    <svg width={width} height={height}>
      <rect fill={color} width={width} height={height} />
    </svg>
  );
};
```
with
```javascript
  return (
    // The content of the svg exported just previously described as of this guide ;p
    // Something like:
    <svg width="1200" height="675" viewBox="0 0 1200 675" fill="none">
       ...
    </svg>
  );
};
```

### 3. Run the app locally

Now in the root project run the server with the following command

```
yarn dev
```
head your browser to http://localhost:3000 so you can already see your new template and to see that in actions


### 4. Define the inputs

Add the control inputs as describe in [add-an-input](https://mechanic.design/docs/v2.0.0-beta.9/#add-an-input) if you have problems with images please refer to this issue https://github.com/designsystemsinternational/mechanic/issues/130 or take inspiration on how I did it on [./functions/event-card/index.js](./functions/event-card/index.js)

### 5. Replace placeholders with inputs

Now that you defined the inputs you can replace the variable name you decided for the inputs inside the svg, search the text / images you want to replace and put the variable names like:

```
{title}
```
